# Bankruptcy Prediction using different risks and features

Hi, This is a Project that I have worked with a couple of great people at AI Variant as an Intern.

The dataset contains 7 features and about 250 companies' data.  
The dataset includes the following variables:  

- **industrial_risk**: Risks involved in the industry the company does business in (0=low risk, 0.5=medium risk, 1=high risk).  
- **management_risk**: Risks involved in the company's management (0=low risk, 0.5=medium risk, 1=high risk).  
- **financial_flexibility**: How flexible is the company with its finances and cash flow (0=low flexibility, 0.5=medium flexibility, 1=high flexibility).  
- **credibility**: Public opinion on the company (0=low credibility, 0.5=medium credibility, 1=high credibility).  
- **competitiveness**: How competitive is the company with other companies (0=low competitiveness, 0.5=medium competitiveness, 1=high competitiveness).  
- **operating_risk**: Risks involved in the operations of the company (0=low risk, 0.5=medium risk, 1=high risk).  
- **class**: bankruptcy, non-bankruptcy (target variable).  

We have used **Profile Report** to get insights into data. We also developed 5 ML models for classification:  
**Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost Classifier**.  

We also created a **Streamlit UI** where the user can select the model they need to make their prediction.  
The UI also displays the confidence level for the prediction made by the models.
